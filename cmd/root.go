Branchy is a CLI helper which generates/creates git branch names from JIRA tickets (summary field)
and automatically copies the branch name to the clipboard (e.g. feat/ABC-1234/this-is-my-branch-name)`,

	Example: `branchy generate feat ABC-1234
branchy g fix ABC-1234`,
}

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
